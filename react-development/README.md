# Date Completed: 
January 8, 2026

# Project Description: 
 This application is a search based application challenge sponsored by Frontend Mentor. The challenge required integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it. The country data included information such as population, region, and capital. The challenged required that users have the ability to search for countries, filter countries by regions and navigate to border countries from individual country pages. The project required the use of React.

# My process:
   
 My process for this project started by overlooking the notes and code from the exact same challenge. However this project required the use of Typescript. It still helped to look at the code because I didn't have to start from scratch with things like fectching or styling for example. The main difference was outlining or organizing the file structure. I had to decide what needed to be a component and what needed to go inside of the Context file. After mapping these files out I started with my types.

# My reflection:

There were a few challenges in this project. It wasn't too difficult but it did take some thought and research to create the best plan of action for folder structure. Creating my CountryContext file really helped me understand the concept of the context purpose. Some things did flow well. Like I knew I had to start with the types file because it would be used by almost all of the other files. The troubleshooting on the project was a nightmare. I finally got things to work and then I couldn't deploy in github or vercel or netlify. It really took longer than it should have. I've never experienced this issue of deploying before but it gave me more lessons to learn and more insight to gain.
